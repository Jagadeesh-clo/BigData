1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location

Ans:
hadoop fs -copyFromLocal /data/hive_class/sales_order_data.csv /tmp/hive_class;

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table

create table sales_order_data_csv
(
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH float,
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES float,
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE string,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE string,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1")
;

4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 

load data inpath "hdfs:///tmp/hive_class/sales_order_data.csv" into table sales_order_data_csv;

5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"

create table sales_order_data_csv_orc
(
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH float,
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES float,
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE string,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE string,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
stored as orc;

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"

from sales_order_data_csv insert overwrite table sales_order_csv_orc select *;

a. Calculatye total sales per year.

Ans: hive>select year_id, sum(sales) from sales_data_ORC group by year_id;

b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed

Ans:-hive> select productline, sum(qtyordered) as Total_Orders from sales_data_ORC group by productline order by Total_Orders desc limit 1;

c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter

Ans:-hive> select qtr_id, sum(sales) from sales_data_ORC group by qtr_id;

d. In which quarter sales was minimum

Ans:-hive> select qtr_id, sum(sales) as total_sales from sales_data_ORC group by qtr_id order by total_sales asc limit 1;;

e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
 
Ans:-hive> select country, sum(sales) as total_sales from sales_data_ORC group by country order by total_sales desc;

f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city

Ans:-hive> select city, qtr_id, sum(sales) as total sales from sales_data_ORC group by city,qtr_id;

g. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold Footer.

Ans:-hive> select year_id, month_id,, sum(qtyordered) as total_sales from sales_data_ORC group by year_id, month_id order by year_id, total_sales desc;
