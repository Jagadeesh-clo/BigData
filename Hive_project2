Q1:1.) Find the total number of tickets for the year.

Ans: 1. select count(distinct summons_number)No_Of_tickets , issue_date from vehicle_parking_partiton where issue_date like '%2017' group by issue_date;

Q2.) Find out how many unique states the cars which got parking tickets came from.

Ans: select count(distinct registration_state) from vehicle_parking_partiton;

Q3.) Some parking tickets donâ€™t have addresses on them, which is cause for concern. Find out how many such tickets there are(i.e. tickets where either "Street Code 1" or "Street Code 2" or "Street Code 3" is empty )

Ans: select count(distinct summons_number)No_Of_tickets from vehicle_parking_partiton where street_code1 =0 or street_code2 =0 or street_code3=0;

Q4.) How often does each violation code occur? (frequency of violation codes - find the top 5)

Ans: select count(violation_code) as frequesncy, violation_code from vehicle_parking_partiton group by violation_code order by frequesncy limit 5;

Q5> How often does each vehicle body type get a parking ticket? How about the vehicle make? (find the top 5 for both)

Ans: select vehicle_body_type, count(summons_number) as frequency from vehicle_parking_partiton group by vehicle_body_type order by frequency desc limit 5;

Q6.) A precinct is a police station that has a certain zone of the city under its command. Find the (5 highest) frequencies of:

      a.) Violating Precincts (this is the precinct of the zone where the violation occurred)

Ans: select violation_precinct, count(violation_precinct) as frequency_precinct from vehicle_parking_partiton group by violation_precinct order by frequency_precinct desc limit  5;

      b.) Issuer Precincts (this is the precinct that issued the ticket)

Ans: select issuer_precinct, count(issuer_precinct) as issuer_precinct_frequency from vehicle_parking_partiton group by issuer_precinct  order by issuer_precinct_frequency desc limit 5;

Q7.) Find the violation code frequency across 3 precincts which have issued the most number of tickets - do these precinct zones have an exceptionally high frequency of certain violation codes?

Answers:
a. select issuer_precinct,violation_code, count(*) as violation_frequency_code group by issuer_precinct, violation_code order by violation_frequency_code desc limit 5;
b. select violation_precinct, count(violation_precinct) as frequency_precinct from vehicle_parking_partiton where issuer_precinct = 18 group by violation_precinct order by frequency_precinct desc limit  5;
c. select violation_precinct, count(violation_precinct) as frequency_precinct from vehicle_parking_partiton where issuer_precinct = 19 group by violation_precinct order by frequency_precinct desc limit  5;
